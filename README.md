# revocation-tracker

This is a small application for tracking WebPKI certificates that should be revoked because they are mississued.

For many years it ran at `https://misissued.com/`, however in November, 2022, it was turned off due to maintenance burden. Backups of the database are available in the `backups/` directory.
